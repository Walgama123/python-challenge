# python-challenge
## Background
In this assignment, you'll use the concepts you've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy
Skilled applied 
Consider what you've learned so far. You've learned how to import modules like csv. You’ve learned how to read and write files in various formats. You’ve learned how to store content in variables, lists, and dictionaries. You’ve learned how to iterate through basic data structures. And you’ve learned how to debug along the way. Using all that you've learned, try to break down your tasks into discrete mini-objectives.
- Import  python libraries (os,csv,collection) and get idea about usability of those 
- Create file path for the data sources
- Read and write to output files (csv,text)
- Learn hoe to store data in variables, list and dictionaries
- Iterate through basic data structures.
## PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
### Task completed
•	The total number of months included in the dataset
•	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
•	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
•	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
•	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
## PyPoll Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".

### Task completed
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
## Folder structure and names
- Parent folder name :<>
- Resources folder : Resources
- Output folder	 :Analys 
main.py (python program file) should be in the root of the parent folder
